This name suggests that the method is building a key with a tag, which is mostly accurate in terms of functionality. However, it doesn’t explicitly mention the concept of size or the action of joining, making it slightly less precise than the first name. \n\n--- \n\nIn summary, \"joinSizeTagToKey\" is the most descriptive and accurate, while \"createsession\" fails to represent the function's purpose entirely. \"sizekeywith\" and \"buildkeywithtag\" are closer but could benefit from clarification.", "names[0]": "joinSizeTagToKey", "scores_c1[0]": 5,"names[1]": "createsession", "scores_c1[1]": 1,  "names[2]": "sizekeywith", "scores_c1[2]": 3,  "names[3]": "buildkeywithtag", "scores_c1[3]": 4}

It is clear and readable but could be more descriptive about the effect of the method instead of just the action.\n  \n**Function Name 2: before**\n- **C1: 2.** This name is vague and does not accurately represent the function's purpose. \"before\" implies a timing aspect of execution, but the method does not indicate any ordering or conditional execution relative to other operations, making this name misleading.\n\n**Function Name 3: onsuccess**\n- **C1: 3.** This name suggests that the method runs a callback upon the successful completion of some operation. While it hints at the behavior of the callback, it does not clearly indicate how the `TemplateEngine` relates to the success state, leading to a somewhat disconnected and not fully accurate description of functionality. \n\n**Function Name 4: callbackwrapper**\n- **C1: 4.** This name indicates that the function serves as a wrapper for the callback function, which is true of what the method does. However, it lacks a certain elegance and could be considered verbose. It accurately describes the method's functionality but does not convey the specifics of its interaction with `TemplateEngine` effectively.\n\n### Summary\n\n1. **Function Name 1: doWith**\n   - **C1: 4.** Accurately describes the action, but could be more descriptive about the type or context of the operation.\n\n2. **Function Name 2: before**\n   - **C1: 2.** Vague and misleading; does not reflect the method's behavior.\n\n3. **Function Name 3: onsuccess**\n   - **C1: 3.** Suggests completion, but lacks clarity regarding how it relates to `TemplateEngine`.\n\n4. **Function Name 4: callbackwrapper**\n   - **C1: 4.** Clearly indicates the function's role, but could be more succinct.", "names[0]": "doWith", "scores_c1[0]": 4,"names[1]": "before", "scores_c1[1]": 2,  "names[2]": "onsuccess", "scores_c1[2]": 3,  "names[3]": "callbackwrapper", "scores_c1[3]": 4}
