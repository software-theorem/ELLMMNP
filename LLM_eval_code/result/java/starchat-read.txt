    Arrays.sort(array);
    return new Characters(true, array);
}
reasons:
**Function Name 1: allBut**
C1: 4. This method returns all characters in the input array except for the specified characters. The method name accurately reflects its functionality.

**Function Name 2: of**
C1: 3. This method returns a set of characters that contains the specified characters. However, the method name is not very specific, as it does not indicate whether it returns a new set or modifies the input set. A more descriptive name would be "contains" or "with".

**Function Name 3: of**
C1: 3. This method returns a set of characters that contains the specified characters. However, the method name is not very specific, as it does not indicate whether it returns a new set or modifies the input set. A more descriptive name would be "contains" or "with".

}
reasons:
**Function Name 1: needApplyTaskTimeout**
C1: 4. This function checks whether a timeout is configured for the task and whether a per-request timeout has been set in the request context. The name accurately reflects the functionality of the method.

**Function Name 2: checktimeout**
C1: 3. This function checks whether a timeout is configured for the task, but it does not consider whether a per-request timeout has been set in the request context. The name is not very specific, and it may be confusing because the method also checks for a per-request timeout.

**Function Name 3: hastimeout**
C1: 2. This function checks whether a timeout has been set for the task, regardless of whether a per-request timeout has been set in the request context. The name is very generic and may be confusing because the method only checks for a timeout, not whether it is applicable.

**Function Name 4: istimeoutsetinrequestcontext**

code:
URI XXXXX() {
    StringBuilder builder = new StringBuilder();

    if (defined(this.scheme)) {
        builder.append(this.scheme);
        builder.append(":");
    }

    if (defined(this.authority)) {
        builder.append("//");
        builder.append(this.authority);
    }

    if (defined(this.path)) {

    }

    if (defined(this.query)) {
        builder.append("?");
        builder.append(this.query);
    }

    if (defined(this.fragment)) {
        builder.append("#");
        builder.append(this.fragment);
    }

    String rawURI = builder.toString();
    return URI.create(rawURI);
}
reasons:
**Function Name 1: toURI**
C1: 4. The method converts the URI object to a string in URI format, which accurately reflects the method's functionality. The name is clear and concise, following the Java naming conventions.

**Function Name 2: touri**
C1: 2. The method name is not very descriptive, and may be difficult to understand for someone unfamiliar with the code. The name is not consistent with Java naming conventions, and contains uppercase letters, which may be confusing.

**Function Name 3: t**
C1: 1. The method name is completely unrelated to the code snippet, and provides no information about its functionality. The name is not consistent with Java naming conventions, and contains only one letter, which may be confusing.

**Function Name 4: generateuri**
C1: 3. The method name is somewhat descriptive, but not very clear or concise. The name is not consistent with Java naming conventions, and contains uppercase letters, which may be confusing.

public static String XXXXX(String key, String tag) {
    return new StringBuilder(key)
            .append(SIZE_SP)
            .append(tag)
            .toString();
}
reasons:
**Function Name 1: joinSizeTagToKey**
C1: 4. This function name accurately describes the method's functionality, which is to concatenate the size and tag to the key. The naming style is clear and concise, and follows the company's coding conventions.

**Function Name 2: createsession**
C1: 2. This function name is vague and generic, and does not accurately describe the method's functionality. The naming style is not clear, and does not follow the company's coding conventions.

**Function Name 3: sizekeywith**
C1: 3. This function name is somewhat descriptive, but not ideal. The naming style is not clear, and does not follow the company's coding conventions.

**Function Name 4: buildkeywithtag**

idx: 24
code:
public Thl XXXXX(final Consumer<TemplateEngine> callback) {
    requireNonNull(callback, "Callback required.");
    return doWith((e, c) -> callback.accept(e));
}
reasons:
**Function Name 1: doWith**
C1: 4. This function name accurately describes the method's functionality (it does "something with" the template engine). The naming style is clear and readable, and follows the established conventions for method names in the codebase.

**Function Name 2: before**
C1: 3. This function name is somewhat descriptive, but not ideal. It does not accurately describe the method's functionality (it is not "before" anything), and the naming style is not particularly clear or readable.

**Function Name 3: onsuccess**
C1: 2. This function name is vague and generic. It does not accurately describe the method's functionality (it is not "on success" of anything), and the naming style is not particularly clear or readable.

**Function Name 4: callbackwrapper**
C1: 1. This function name is completely unrelated to the method's functionality. It does not accurately describe the method's purpose (it is not a "wrapper" for a callback), and the naming style is not particularly clear or readable.
