**abbreviations.json**
This file is a dictionary mapping words to their corresponding abbreviations, used to check for consistency in method naming.

**classifications.py**
This file identifies five types of low-quality method names in the target file, including:

- Single noun or preposition
- Obscure abbreviation
- Broad meaning
- Digits in word
- Inconsistent naming

**filtration.py**
This file filters out low-quality method names from the original data, ensuring that the output contains only high-quality naming entries.



We release the dataset in this [website](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1HEt58MW8tvJrwLvgDQ4Cx6BW9kQuHWj2?usp=drive_link).



The following is a table of statistics on the treatment of low-quality method namesï¼š
